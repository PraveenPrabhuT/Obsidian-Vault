**Filicide** is the deliberate act of a parent killing their own child. The word _filicide_ is derived from the [Latin](/wiki/Latin "Latin") words _filius_ and _filia_ ('son' and 'daughter') and the suffix _-cide_, from the word _caedere_ meaning 'to kill'. The word can refer to both the crime and perpetrator of the crime.

## Statistics

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Filicide&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Statistics")]

A 1999 U.S. Department of Justice study concluded that mothers were responsible for a higher share of children killed [during infancy](/wiki/Infanticide "Infanticide") between 1976 and 1997 in the United States, while fathers were more likely to have been responsible for the murders of children aged eight or older.[[1]](#cite_note-1) Parents were responsible for 61% of child murders under the age of five.[[2]](#cite_note-2) Sometimes, there is a combination of murder and suicide in filicide cases. On average, according to FBI statistics, 450 children are murdered by their parents each year in the United States.[[3]](#cite_note-3)

An in-depth [longitudinal study](/wiki/Longitudinal_study "Longitudinal study") of 297 cases convicted of filicide and 45 of filicide-suicide in the [United Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") between 1997 and 2006 showed that 37% of the perpetrators had a recorded mental illness at the time. The most common diagnoses were [mood disorders](/wiki/Mood_disorder "Mood disorder") and [personality disorders](/wiki/Personality_disorder "Personality disorder") rather than [psychosis](/wiki/Psychosis "Psychosis"), but the latter accounted for 15% of cases. However – similar to findings in a large Danish study – the majority had not had contact with mental health services prior to the murders, and few had received treatment. Female perpetrators were more likely to have given birth as teenagers. Fathers were more likely to have been convicted of violent offences and have a history of substance misuse, and were more likely to kill multiple victims. Infants were more likely to be victims than older children, and a link to [post-partum depression](/wiki/Post-partum_depression "Post-partum depression") was suggested.[[4]](#cite_note-4)

## Types of filicide

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Filicide&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Types of filicide")]

Dr. Phillip Resnick published research on filicide in 1969 and stated that there were five main motives for filicide, including "altruistic", "fatal maltreatment", "unwanted child", "acutely psychotic" and "spousal revenge".[[5]](#cite_note-CTV-5) "Altruistic" killings occur because the parent believes that the world is too cruel for the child, or because the child is enduring suffering (whether this is actually occurring or not). In fatal maltreatment killings, the goal is not always to kill the child, but death may occur anyway, and [Munchausen syndrome by proxy](/wiki/Munchausen_syndrome_by_proxy "Munchausen syndrome by proxy") is in that category. Spousal revenge killings are killings of children done to indirectly harm a domestic partner; they do not frequently occur.[[5]](#cite_note-CTV-5) Glen Carruthers, author of "Making sense of spousal revenge filicide", argued that those who engage in spousal revenge killings see their own children as objects.[[6]](#cite_note-6)

## Children at risk

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Filicide&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Children at risk")]

In 2013, in the United States, homicide was in the top five causes of deaths of children, and in the top three causes of death in children between 1 and 4 years old.[[7]](#cite_note-7) A direct correlation has been identified between child abuse rates and child homicide rates. Research suggests that children murdered by their parents were physically abused by them prior to their death.[[8]](#cite_note-8)

In [South Asia](/wiki/South_Asia "South Asia") and the [Middle East](/wiki/Middle_East "Middle East"), many homicide cases were due to parents killing their children after being accused of [violating the family's reputation](/wiki/Honor_killing "Honor killing"); daughters were most likely to be murdered in these killings.[[9]](#cite_note-9)

The account is doubted by Roman [historian](/wiki/Historian "Historian") [Livy](/wiki/Livy "Livy"), due to similarities to stories about the family of Titus Manlius Imperiosus Torquatus (see below).[[12]](#cite_note-12)|

His father [Titus Manlius Torquatus](/wiki/Titus_Manlius_Torquatus_\(consul_165_BC\) "Titus Manlius Torquatus (consul 165 BC)"), a senior [Senator](/wiki/Roman_Senate "Roman Senate"), was granted permission to privately try his son in his home. Despite knowing that the family code of honour would compel his son to commit [suicide](/wiki/Suicide "Suicide"), Titus sentenced his son to banishment from his sight, causing Manlianus to take his own life. His severity was supposedly inspired by his descendance from the equally severe Titus Manlius Imperiosus Torquatus (see above).[[14]](#cite_note-14)[[15]](#cite_note-15)|

According to historian [Cassius Dio](/wiki/Cassius_Dio "Cassius Dio"), Tiberius placed Livilla in the custody of her mother Antonia, who locked her up in a room where she was [starved](/wiki/Starvation "Starvation") to death.[[18]](#cite_note-18)|
