description: "Obsidian has been the centerpiece of my self-education for 10 months now, proving itself as the perfect outlet for my reading, writing and thinking. By combining mini-essays with the Zettelkasten system, I've created a workflow which fits my learning like a glove, and I hope it'll work the same for you. Here, notes go beyond mere online post-it notes. They're opportunities to learn, to practice writing, to store big ideas and to serve your future projects in any creative endeavor you love.
