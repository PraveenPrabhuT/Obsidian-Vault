#CS #AI/chatGPT 
# Em Dashes
- em dashes "—" is a type of punctuation mark used to create a strong break in a sentence
- they are longer than a hyphen "-" or an en dash "–" 
- this is rarely seen in real life, as it is not very convenient to type this, nor is the usage and difference between a normal hyphen well understood.
- this is actually _overused_ by [[ChatGPT]], which has lead to this being an obvious sign that the content is [[AI]] Generated
