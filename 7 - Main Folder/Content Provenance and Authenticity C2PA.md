#CS #OpenStandard 
# Content Provenance and Authenticity
- Content Provenance and Authenticity is an open standard developed by a group of various countries
- It is actually a unification of [[Adobe]] lead initiative [[Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI)]] and [[Project Origin]], led by [[Microsoft]] and BBC.
- It is more like a **[[Metadata]]** than a _watermark_ 
- It can be easily removed - most social media platforms strip the metadata from the image - **mainly for privacy purposes**
