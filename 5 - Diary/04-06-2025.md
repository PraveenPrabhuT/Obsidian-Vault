# Summary
Finally after 3 days of tweaking around with Obsidian, going through countless YouTube videos, reddit posts and blog entries, and adding a dozen plugins, half of which I'm unsure of what they do, I have finally started to write my first note. I hope to build a knowledge system in the upcoming days that could make linking, thinking, understanding and learning more efficient.

## Exam

Today was the last end term exam of sixth semester. I had CSG 302 Site Reliability Engineering and DevOps Exam. I woke up at 9 for the 930 exam and sat to write the exam at 930. The exam wouldn't open for anyone. I think there was some error on the backend of the Codetantra SEA app.
This was the error message.

From the first line, it looked like there was some problem with loading the question paper. Finally at around 1010, the exam portal opened and I could attempt the exam. It was a pretty easy exam with simple questions. It took me about 15 20 minutes to attempt the whole exam.
