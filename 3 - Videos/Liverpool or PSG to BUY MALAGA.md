# 🌍 What It's About
- PSG and Liverpool are looking to buy [[LaLiga]] 2nd division division team Malaga CF.
- It is owned by Qatari investor  [Abdullah ben Nasser Al Thani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_bin_Nasser_bin_Abdullah_Al_Ahmed_Al_Thani "Abdullah bin Nasser bin Abdullah Al Ahmed Al Thani").
- It is currently 15th in Segunda Division.
- In Feb 2020, a Malaga judge called for exit of Al Thani for financial fraud.
- The club was in LaLiga and even qualified for #football/UCL in 2012, quarter finals in 2013.
- After this they were sanctioned by UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules in 2010s, and they were banned from 2013-14 Europa league because of this.
- Now, [[PSG]]'s owners, [[Qatari Sports Investments (QSI)]] are looking to purchase Malaga CF for around  **€100 million**. 
> _QSI is currently exploring a number of strategic investment opportunities across Europe and the Americas_

# 🧠 Thoughts
- The reason why both parties are interested in this team is because Malaga is the [[Largest Cities in Spain|6th largest city in Spain]] and their stadium is a potential host to the [[2030 FIFA World Cup]], which will be co-hosted by Spain, Portugal and Morocco.
- The stadium is also planned to undergo renovations to prepare for the world cup.
- Liverpool were in talks to acquire [[Bordeaux FC]] last year, currently a 4th division [[Ligue 1]] Club, but pulled out as they wanted a bigger European Club
