description: "ChatGPT leaving watermarks in the text that it writes for you? Is AI turning on us? Or just a quirk of reinforcement learning as OpenAI have come out and said about these invisible characters? Here's how to reveal and remove them from the text that ChatGPT's new o3 and o4-mini models generate for you. #openai #aitools #ai #artificialintelligence #tech #technology #chatgpt #GenAI #generativeai"

# 🌍 What It's About
- [[ChatGPT]] is adding invisible watermarks to its generated texts.
- The [[LLM]] is adding =="zero-width spaces"==([[Unicode|Unicode Characters]]) to the generated content, specifically the _Narrow No-Break Space (U+202F)_ and _zero-width spaces (U+200B)_
- This is said to be done so that the model ignores this content as AI generated content when it is trained on new data, thus helping in [[reinforcement learning]]
- This was identified in the o3/o4 model
- This is similar to the "[[em dashes]]"(—),  a character that is kind of a dead giveaway of AI and ChatGPT generated content
- Similar watermarking is present in the AI generated images by [[DALL E ]] - This was done using the [[Content Provenance and Authenticity C2PA|C2PA]] Open standard.
